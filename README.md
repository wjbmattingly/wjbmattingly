Hi there! I'm William Mattingly, a postdoctoral fellow at the Smithsonian Data Science Lab. My work focuses on the intersection of history, artificial intelligence, and natural language processing. With a PhD in Medieval History, I specialize in the application of AI on archival documents, particularly those associated with the Holocaust and human rights violations in South Africa.

As a researcher, I am passionate about exploring Natural Language Processing (NLP) for ancient and medieval languages. This passion drives me to bridge the gap between traditional historical studies and advanced computational analysis, providing unique and essential perspectives in the field.

## Research Interests

- Ethical application of AI on archival documents
- Holocaust and Human Rights documents
- NLP for ancient and medieval languages
- Digital Humanities
- Data Science and History

## Projects

Here are some of the projects that I've been working on.
